# Suggestions/Requests  
Go ahead and give me suggestions/requests in the issues(or dms) and I'll try my best to implement them

# Features
this list wont be updated actively so i'd recommend checking the releases instead
- MapInfo - see the current level, min haul & max haul on your screen at all time (this is estimated using maths and doesnt touch anything in the scene)
- NoiseLogger - minecraft subtitles ported over to repo in its most basic form
- NetworkInfo - get jitter or ping alerts in the top right corner (IN VERY SMALL TEXT SO ITS NOT ANNOYING)
- Freelook - rust freelook ported to repo (it disables if your camera is controlled by something or your holding a trap)
- FastIntro - speed up how long it takes for the buttons to appear on the intro screen (its annoying as fuck!)
- Steal/Download map - ever had that one friend who hosts then falls asleep? now you can download the map from them and host it
- Waypoints - complex waypoints that fade in/out that you can place manually (resets every level change)
- Waypoint macros - lets you create a pre-defined template for a waypoint that you can just click to place
- Clyde themes - not related to repo but its worth noting

some misc things that might be removed
- AccountSpoofer - randomizes your name ping and colour for public matches (privacy)
- PingSpoof - spoofs your ping to a constant 20-21 (privacy)
- RainbowSkincolour - its harmless so i thought i'd add it for a bit (will go soon)
